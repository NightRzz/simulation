The goal of the project is to write an object-oriented simulation application in Java. For visualization the graphical library Swing is used.

The application implements 2 main classes of organisms:
* Animals 
* Plants

These classes are expanded into subspecies, which have their own behavioral and characteristic features.

The player can control the movement of the human. In addition, the human has a special ability that strengthens him by 5 points, and his strength will decrease with each round to the value before the skill. After reaching pre-ability value, next 5 rounds skill can't be activated.

It is also possible to add an organism to a specific position by simply clicking on the square where you want to add an organism, and in the menu that appears, select the creature you want to add.

There are 2 ways to control the simulation:
* With buttons in the GUI
* With keys on the keyboard

The application also allows you to save and load the current state of the simulation. On startup, the simulation world is filled with creatures in random order
